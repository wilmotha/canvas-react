# canvas-react

Any one who has used canvas will know that it is increadibly slow. The idea here is to make viewing your grades and assignments in canvas much faster. 

Right now viewing grades is very fast, but there is a lot of other functionality I would love to add to make it more of a complete canvas experience. Some of this I can add over time others I am limited by the fact that I am not a canvas admin.

One main limitation to not being a canvas adim is that I do not have access to a client id, meaning I cannot set up user auth. Instead I let people request tokens from canvas and then use that to login. This is not ideal but this website is more of a concept than a real production anything.

If anyone can make me a canvas admin that would be cool:)
